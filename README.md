General idea repository

Greetings friends, enemies, neutral aquaintances, fellow human, android, animal, mineral or Equestrian quadropedic creature.
This is a basic repository of basically just general stuff I think up of that might be cool, interesting, intriguing, thought-provoking or just otherwise really freakin' awesome! :3

Oh yeah, and um... It'll probably soon be updated to consolidate a Linux dirstobution project me and a fellow pony-obsessive friend are currently in the works of, so yey! :v

Okay, sooo ummm... This is a little edit into this just for stuff... Ummm...... I don't know what to put here sooo IDEA LIST!!! ^3^

1. Flush out Silver-Ember Pony OC idea and perhaps begin creating a whole backstory and fanfiction based upon him.
2. Create theme-specific wallpapers for Twibuntu project.
3. Create custom themed icons for Twibuntu project.
4. Finish that drawing of Vinyl Scratch that is currently on hold because my mom wanted to take pictures from my sketchbook for a scrapbook or something.
5. Continue on this strange journey of trying to sort out and figure out how to use these things like "emotions" and "self-esteem" and various other things in hopes that I can identify how to actually understand before too long and becoming utterly insane and possibly psychotic.
6. Become one of those "obnoxious" bronies who can't figure out how to stop spamming pony-content in everypony's face.
7. <s>Create a basic checklist of 'things to accomplish and ideas to ponder upon'...... Oh wait...... I did this one just now.</s> :P

# hello-world
General idea repository

Greetings friends, enemies, neutral aquaintances, fellow human, android, animal, mineral or Equestrian quadropedic creature.
This is a basic repository of basically just general stuff I think up of that might be cool, interesting, intriguing, thought-provoking or just otherwise really freakin' awesome! :3

Oh yeah, and um... It'll probably soon be updated to consolidate a Linux dirstobution project me and a fellow pony-obsessive friend are currently in the works of, so yey! :v
